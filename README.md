Objectives
The objective of this assignment is to build a regression model that predicts the delivery time for
orders placed through Porter. The model will use various features such as the items ordered,
the restaurant location, the order protocol, and the availability of delivery partners.
The key goals are:
- Predict the delivery time for an order based on multiple input features
- Improve delivery time predictions to optimize operational efficiency
- Understand the key factors influencing delivery time to enhance the model accuracy
